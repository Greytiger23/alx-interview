# Island Perimeter

this project involves implementing a function to calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a grid. The grid is composed of `0`s (representing water) and `1`s (representing land). The task is to determine the perimeter of the island by counting the edges that either adjacent to water or at the boundary of the grid.

## Function Prototype

```python
def island_perimeter(grid):
	"""
	Calculates the perimeter of the island in the grid.

	:param grid: List of list of integers representing the grid
	:return: The perimeter of the island
	"""
