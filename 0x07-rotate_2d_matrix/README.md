# 0x07 - Rotate 2D Matrix Readme

## Overview

This directory contains a solution to the problem of rotating an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation is performed in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified directly without using extra space.

## Problem Statement

Given an n x n matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation should be done in-place.

### Function Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotate the given n x n matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place.
    """
